You can run the app simply by running "npm install" & "npm start" in the terminal.


## Important messages


Typescript was not used... 

I would definetely like to learn TypeScript but on this project only thing that was related to TypeScript is the .tsx which ended up
useless...


App Architecture...

As I said in my cover letter I didn't use React for a while now, I was busy doing other project related mainly to design.
Therefore, I think that the logic I put down could definetely be better, especially with not the most efficient fetching. I had some stuff to do so
I didn't have the time to restructure. This mistake was mainly due to jumping right into the project without planning it out. 


I am a fast learner , none of these will be an issue in the future.
